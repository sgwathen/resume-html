        <p >
        	I studied close to home so I could make a living for myself, and just happened to change my major early because of B-Hive Printing, where I worked since graduating high school.  Being close to home, yet wanting independence, led me to live on campus, which eventually led me to becoming a Resident Assistant.  My life is where it is now because of my experiences.
